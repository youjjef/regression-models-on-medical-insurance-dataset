# regression-models-on-medical-insurance-dataset
 It is a project about regression.The goal is make a model that fits these data and
predicts the charge for the new persons that the medical insurance should cover.
I used two different models to compare between them : a simple linear regression model and xgboost model.
The xgboost model got better results with higher accuracy.
